# Pinta's Quest

Pinta's Quest is a VMU game associated with the Dreamcast version of Skies of Arcadia. The game drops can be manipulated via doing certain actions with given timing. This is a tool to help people with those timings to manipulate the desired drops.

Sanic of the Skies of Arcadia Speedrun community pioneered most of these manipulations and created the original code this is based off of here.

# Improvements
- Original had hard coded amplitudes for sound detection. This made it very finicky for the VMU sounds to be detected properly on different devices.
